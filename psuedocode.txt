#This file has the pseudo-code for notes to start a program for calculating the detector's geometrical factor. 

#Formulae: assuming isotropic flux and seperable from energy, G=integral over solid angle observed times integral over the exposed area of detector.
#in detail: integral dw over all solid angle times integral over d(sigma) dot r-hat which points into direction of particle incoming. 


# 1st test should be to simply recover for one planar detector observing 1/2 sky. should be G=pi*A_{detector}



// psuedo-code//

// TRandom sampling of point on grid for detector
// TRandom sampling of trajectory** through that point (is the particles trajectory).
// ** optional ** follow trajectory to pass through another detector?
// Plots in intermediate steps to make sure the sampling is being done correct. 
//  // These plots include: theta vs phi for the particle trajectory (to see uniform sampling of that) and point on detector area (to see uniform sampling of that). 
// Will should be able to start this.
